  abstract	= {The method of calculation is shown whereby a formula has
		  been derived that states approximately the ratio of the
		  rate of accumulation of advantageous mutant genes in a
		  population that undergoes recombination to the rate in an
		  otherwise non-recombining one. A table is give showing the
		  ratios thus found for diferent frequencues of advantageous
		  mutations and different degrees of their advantage. It is
		  shown that this calculation does not apply for mutant genes
		  that act advantageously only when in som especial
		  combination with one or more other mutant genes, and that
		  as gar as these cases of special synergism are concerned
		  recombining lines have no evolutionary advantage over
		  non-recombining ones. Other limitations of the formula are
		  pointed out and assessed. It is explained that most factors
		  that retard the rate of recombination - for example,
		  inkage, rarity of outbreeding, intercalation of sexual
		  reproduction between more frequent cycles of asexual
		  propagation, and partial isolation between subpopulations -
		  must usually cause little long-term retardation of the
		  speed of advance that is fostered by recombination.
		  Moreover, even where long-term evolution has virtually
		  ceased, recombination of mutant genes still confers upon a
		  population the means of adopting short-term genetic
		  "dodges", that adjust it to ecological and physical changes
		  in its circumstances, much more rapidly than would be
		  possible for a comparable asexual population. Under
		  conbditions where only stablility of type is neede, a
		  non-recombining population does not actually degenerate as
		  a result of an excess of mutation over selection, after the
		  usual equilibrium between these pressures is reached.
		  However, a kind of irreversible ratchet mechanism exists in
		  the non-recombining species (unlike the recombining ones)
		  that prevents selection, even if intinsified, from reducing
		  the mutational loads below the lightest that were in
		  existence when the intensified selection started, whereas,
		  contriwise, "drift" and what might be called "selective
		  noise" must allow occasional slips of the lightest loads in
		  the direction of increased weight.}
